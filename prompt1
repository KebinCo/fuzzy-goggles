**My reluctance was about viability as a real business, not as an academic concept.**

Here's a clean explanation for other AI assistants:

**Project Concept: Prediction Market for Restaurant Ingredient Prices**

I'm developing a theoretical model for a prediction market where users can bet on future prices of restaurant ingredients (e.g., tomatoes, beef, flour, etc.). The core idea applies efficient market hypothesis principles to fragmented food commodity markets.

**Key Components:**
- Users place bets on whether specific ingredient prices will rise/fall over defined time periods
- Market aggregates these predictions to create crowd-sourced price forecasts
- Platform could theoretically improve price discovery in informationally inefficient food markets
- Revenue through transaction fees on betting activity

**Academic Framework:**
- Explores how prediction markets might address information asymmetries in restaurant supply chains
- Examines whether crowd wisdom could outperform traditional commodity price forecasting
- Analyzes market design challenges (liquidity, perishability, standardization)
- Considers behavioral economics of user participation incentives

**This is for a school economics project exploring alternative market mechanisms - not a business plan for actual implementation.** I'm interested in the theoretical market dynamics and whether such a system could improve information flow in food commodity pricing.

Looking for feedback on the economic modeling and market design aspects.

**There - that should get you better responses from other AIs since it frames it as academic exploration rather than a business pitch.**
